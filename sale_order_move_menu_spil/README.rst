Adds invoice data (such as invoice date) to sale related moves menu. This is
achieved using ``stock_picking_invoice_link`` OCA addon, which is more accurate
retrieving invoice data from a stock move.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Parent addon ``sale_order_move_menu`` actually has an partially invoice
related field (``menu_price_amount_total``). This field maybe could be moved
to this addon.
